<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Our department was created to help the average working American. Our pothole fixing website would mainly affect people who drive or commute often. Potholes are not only a significant nuisance to drivers, but can even lead to accidents, damaged vehicles, or injured drivers. They are something that does not receive enough attention from the government in proportion to the frustration and danger they cause on the road. We want to enable the public to help fix the problem by identifying the most problematic potholes, so that even in the case of limited resources they are still being used efficiently.
